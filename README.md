# python3-bookstore
A little python3(3.8.2)+tkinter app that allows user to keep track,add,update and delete books from a local database (sql
ite).No database authorization connection needed.tkinter was installed on my Ubuntu machine with the command:"sudo apt install python3-tk",as pip/pip3 installs don't work.
